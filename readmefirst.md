# Applications

Hi everyone! 

If you're here thinking about a project, welcome! The purpose of this tutorial is to give a basic guide on a bare-bones vessel, which allows you, the researcher, to use it in any way you want. If you are sampling algea in a local waterway to mapping a lakebed with LiDAR, those modules can be attached to the boat in some form. A simple bouy or pontoons for the current vessel would be effective solutions. Please post any questions you may have and I'd be glad to help!

Here are some links to get you started!
