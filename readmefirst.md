# Applications

Hi everyone! 

If you're here thinking about a project, welcome! The purpose of this tutorial is to give a basic guide on a bare-bones vessel, which allows you, the researcher, to use it in any way you want. If you are sampling algea in a local waterway to mapping a lakebed with LiDAR, those modules can be attached to the boat in some form. A simple bouy or pontoons for the current vessel would be effective solutions. Please post any questions you may have and I'd be glad to help!
